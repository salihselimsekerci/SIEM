# SIEM Project

This project is a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool designed for real-time threat detection and response.

## Features
- Log collection from various sources (servers, applications, network devices).
- Storage of logs in Elasticsearch.
- Real-time log parsing and threat detection.
- Extensible design for further development.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install elasticsearch
    ```

2. Run the log collector:
    ```bash
    python log_collector/collector.py
    ```

## Future Development
- Implement advanced threat detection using machine learning.
- Develop a web-based management dashboard.
- Create automated response mechanisms for detected threats.
